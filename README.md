ClassFinder  
---------------
ClassFinder is an based on Abilene Christian University's campus  
Pick point A (where you are) and point B(where you want to go) to find how to get to point B

This app is *functional* but is not completed...

How ClassFinder works:

"See Full Acu Map" -> A picture of the whole campus is shown  
"Go to Building List" -> Goes to a list of all the buildings on campus  

Select a building to start.  
Select a building to end.  
*(note that most combinations of start to end are not implemented and will give errors)*  

**These combinations works**  
A.B. Barret -> Bennet Gymnasium  
A.B. Morris Hall -> Cullen Auditorium  
Brown Library -> A.B. Barret  

When on the path page, you can return to either start or end pages to reselect a building.
